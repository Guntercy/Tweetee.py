# Tweetee.py
This is a Python script that uses the tweepy and random libraries to tweet out a randomly selected quote from a list of quotes. The script authenticates with the Twitter API using the provided API keys and access tokens.
The script has a list of quotes stored in the quotes variable. It then has a function called get_quote that selects a random quote from the list and returns it. The function first checks if all quotes have been tweeted, and if they have, it clears the list of tweeted quotes. Then, it selects a random quote from the list and checks if it has been tweeted already. If it has, the function will select a new quote until it finds one that has not been tweeted yet.
The script then enters an infinite loop where it gets a quote using the get_quote function, tweets it out, and then waits for an hour before tweeting again. The script also handles errors that may occur while tweeting, such as if the rate limit has been reached or if the tweet is a duplicate.
